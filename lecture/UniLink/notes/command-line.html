<h1>A bit of History</h1>
<p>In today&#x27;s world, modern technology, particularly computers, has empowered us to achieve incredible feats. However, despite their capabilities, we have noticed that some students view operating computers as mere &quot;magic spells&quot; to effortlessly handle any task. This mindset can lead them into trouble when confronted with more complex challenges.</p>
<p>The way we usually operate our computers is by mouse and keyboard - by dragging the clicking the so-called &#x27;window&#x27; stuff on your screen, and sometimes type something into it. This is called a <em>GUI interface</em> - GUI stands for Graphical User Interface - things are perfectly laid to you over the screen. When a window comes up, some possible operations are now clearly in front of you. Even if you haven&#x27;t seen the window, you will be instantly clear what it means and respond quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>It also suggests that there is another different way of operating computers. Shortly speaking, by purely typing. That is, type some commands into the computer and let them give us the result. This is called <em>CLI interface</em> - CLI stands for Command Line Interface.</p>
<p>GUIs were a hot topic in the early 1980s. With GUI, techical companies can easily permote their techical product to more customers. By packing many features into a button with a single click, they can of course hit the markets.</p>
<p>This leads to a weird question: Why do CLIs exist, even in today? Intuitively, the behavior of CLIs are somehow confused, and of course, not easy to use.</p>
<p>But is it true? We will start to investigate this problem in this topic.</p>
<h1>You Have One in Windows</h1>
<p>CLI still exists in Windows. In fact, in higher versions of Windows, there are 2 CLIs. In this section, we will take a glance at the relatively primitive one, the CMD program.</p>
<h2>Using the shell</h2>
<p>The way to launch the shell is simple: press <code>WINDOWS</code>+<code>R</code>, type in <code>cmd</code>. Then a window in black will appear with words</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>C:<span style="color: #AA5D1F; font-weight: bold">\U</span>sers<span style="color: #AA5D1F; font-weight: bold">\A</span>dmin<span style="color: #AA5D1F; font-weight: bold">\&gt;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>_
</pre></div>

<p>This means that your current working directory is under the path <code>C:\Users\Admin</code>. Files and changes you make will reflect to this directory by default.</p>
<p><code>C:\Users\Admin</code> reflects that this is equivalent to starting File Explorer, or My Computer, click on the disk <code>C</code> icon, then <code>Users</code> folder, then <code>Admin</code> folder. You are currently working on this directory.</p>
<p>Like in file explorer, you are curious about how to go around this stuff, that is navigating in this shell. But before doing this, we will watch how this launch applications.</p>
<p>First let&#x27;s run a program just under the path. If you don&#x27;t have a proper program to run, I have one application named <code>hello.exe</code> that can print <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> to the screen.</p>
<p>Type in</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>hello.exe<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>
</pre></div>

<p>and maybe you will see <code>Hello World</code> displaying on the screen. If you see an error message, maybe you have mistaken the place for this program.</p>

    </div>
